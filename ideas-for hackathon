- scheduling of traffic related problems

PROBLEM:

I just got a project that we could possibly work on for the Local Hack Day. 
There is a small company whose business is providing transportation to patients 
ACTIONS:
(e.g. pick them up form their home and send them to hospitals for their appointments), 
and the manager wants a scheduling program that could give him the most efficient arrangement for the drivers' routes so that each driver can take as many patients as he could per day. 

The input is a MS Excel sheet contains the necessary information 
(such as the patient's home address, 
the hospital's address, 
the appointment time, etc),

 and the output is expected to be also a MS Excel sheet. I personally think this is an interesting and challenging project, so I just bring it up to see if you are interested.
